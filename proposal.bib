  abstract     = {The article presents two Matlab-based tools for analysis andsimulation of real-time control systems: Jitterbug andTrueTime.Jitterbug allows the user to compute aquadratic performance criterion for a linear control system undervarious timing conditions. The control system is described using anumber of continuous- and discrete-time linear systems. Astochastic timing model with random delays is used to describe theexecution of the system. The tool can also be used to investigateaperiodic controllers, multirate controllers, and jitter-compensatingcontrollers.TrueTime facilitates event-based co-simulation of amultitasking real-time kernel containing controller tasks and thecontinuous dynamics of controlled plants. The simulations capture thetrue, timely behavior of real-time controller tasks and communicationnetworks, and dynamic control and scheduling strategies can beevaluated from a control performance perspective. The controllers canbe implemented as Matlab functions, C functions, or ordinarydiscrete-time Simulink blocks.A number of examples that illustrate the use of the tools are given.},
